# knn
## project title Make the prediction for "iris,csv" using KNN algorithm of machine learning,to find the value of K for supervice learning clustering
## STEPS TO WRITE THE KNN 
1. host the data 
2. loading the data with the sklearn
3. split the data train_test_client
4. applying classifier
5. fitting the model
6. predict the model values
7. check your accuracy

## project approach

if value of k = 2 means clustering called as by linear clustering
## conclusion 
if k=3 succesfully implemented
